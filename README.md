# Buldozer-price-prediction
## Discription 
In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a regression problem.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from -[the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from the -[fast.ai machine learning course.](https://course18.fast.ai/ml)
## Code 
Use of regression model from scikit learn library is used here. The RandomForestRegressior is used to predict the sales price.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SKlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


These are some libraries you need to use while working on this project
